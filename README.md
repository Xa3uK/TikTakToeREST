# Tic Tac Toe API

A multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game over REST. Two players register, join matchmaking, and take turns making moves. The server tracks game state and detects wins and draws.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin 2.2** + **Spring Boot 4.0** (Spring MVC)
- **Spring Data JDBC** + **PostgreSQL** — persistence with Flyway migrations
- **BCrypt** (`spring-security-crypto`) — password hashing
- **springdoc-openapi 2.8.6** — Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html`
- **Docker Compose** — local setup with one command

## Running Locally

### With Docker Compose

**Prerequisites:** Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts two containers:

- **db** — PostgreSQL 16 on port `5432`, database `tiktaktoe`, user `postgres`, password `postgres`. Data is persisted in a named volume `postgres_data`.
- **app** — the Spring Boot application on port `8080`, built from the local `Dockerfile`. Waits for the database healthcheck before starting. Flyway migrations run automatically on startup.

API docs and playground: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

### Without Docker (local PostgreSQL)

**Prerequisites:** PostgreSQL running locally.

Create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tiktaktoe;
```

Update `src/main/resources/application.yml` with your connection details:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/tiktaktoe
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
```

Then run the application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Flyway will apply all migrations automatically on startup.

## API Overview

### Players

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/players` | Register a new player → 201 |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/players/{playerId}/games` | List all games for a player → 200 |

### Games

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/games/join` | Join matchmaking — creates or joins a game → 200 |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/games/{gameId}` | Get game state (add `?playerId=` for personal context) → 200 |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/games/{gameId}/moves` | Make a move → 200 |

### Register a Player

```
POST /api/v1/players
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "alice",
  "password": "secret"
}
```

Returns `201 Created` with the assigned `playerId`.

### Join Matchmaking

```
POST /api/v1/games/join
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "playerId": 1,
  "password": "secret"
}
```

If no waiting game is available, creates one with status `WAITING`. Otherwise joins an existing game and transitions it to `IN_PROGRESS`. X always moves first.

### Get Game State

```
GET /api/v1/games/{gameId}
GET /api/v1/games/{gameId}?playerId={playerId}
```

Without `playerId` returns a spectator view (no `yourSymbol`, `yourTurn`, or `availableMoves`). With `playerId` returns personal context including available moves when it is your turn.

### Make a Move

```
POST /api/v1/games/{gameId}/moves
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "playerId": 1,
  "password": "secret",
  "row": 0,
  "col": 2
}
```

`row` and `col` are zero-based (0–2). Returns the updated game state. Returns `409` if the move is invalid (wrong turn, cell occupied, game not in progress) or if a concurrent update conflict occurred — retry in that case.

### List Player Games

```
GET /api/v1/players/{playerId}/games
```

Returns all games the player is assigned to, with status and opponent username.

### Game response fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `board` | 5-element list rendering the 3×3 grid with separators |
| `yourSymbol` | `"X"` or `"O"` — present when `playerId` is provided |
| `yourTurn` | `true` if it is your turn — present when `playerId` is provided |
| `nextTurn` | Symbol of the player who moves next (spectator-friendly) |
| `availableMoves` | List of `{row, col}` objects — present only on your turn |
| `status` | `WAITING` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `FINISHED` |
| `winner` | `"X"`, `"O"`, or `null` (draw) — present when `FINISHED` |

## Authentication

Each move request requires the player's ID and password. There are no sessions or tokens — credentials are verified per request using BCrypt.

## Concurrency

Games use **optimistic locking** (`@Version` column). If two requests update the same game simultaneously, one will receive `409 Conflict` with `{"error": "...retry"}`. The client should retry.

## Error Responses

All errors return `{"error": "<message>"}` with the appropriate HTTP status:

| Status | Cause |
|--------|-------|
| `400` | Username already taken |
| `401` | Wrong player ID or password |
| `404` | Player or game not found |
| `409` | Invalid move, game not in progress, wrong turn, cell occupied, or concurrent update conflict |
